				<h3 class = "project-intro">Connect 4.0 combines the tactile interaction of
					traditional board games with the smart and responsive
					experience that we're all used to with mobile gaming.
					The LCD display prompts each player to make their
					moves whilst the infrared sensors on the top of each
					column will keep track of where each player has gone.
					An Arduino mega board on the back of the game is used
					to process these inputs and lets you know when the
					game has been won.
					The board is made from 4mm plywood board that was
					laser cut in the workshop. Finger joints are used to make
					the structure more durable. The counters are made from
					3D-printed PLA which was spray painted neon pink and
					green. This colour scheme was carried through to the
					project poster to achieve a bright and playful design.
					I was able to display this project as part of the ‘Design
					Futures’ exhibit at the Great Exhibition Road Festival in
					June 2022. It was very gratifying to see so many visitors
					playing with it, and it served as a great opportubity for
					large-scale user testing.</h3>
